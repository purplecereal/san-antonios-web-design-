                    <p>As of June 18th, 2021 There are currently 1,216,435,462 websites. <br>
                        200,839,130 websites are active. 
                        <br><br>      
                         252,000 new websites are created every day.<br>

                        175 new websites are created every minute.<br>  
                        3 new websites are created every second.<br>  
                        An amazing 2000+ new websites will be created by the time you are done reading this article.<br>  
                       


                       <br><br>      
					   Not every new site that is created is solely created just for money. However, many of them are. That being said several factors come into play that decides how much any of these 1.2 billion websites make and of course how much the average website owner makes.
</p>
                       <br><br>      
                       <h2 style="padding-bottom: 5%;padding-top: 10%;">Typical website revenue </h2>     
                       
                       <img src="./images/undraw_pay_online_b1hk.svg" alt="an image of businesss men pulling money out of a wallet" loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 8%;padding-bottom: 10%;">

                       <p>               
                            
There is a big difference in how different website owners can make on average. <br>Most of this depends on several things.
<br><br>
1. Does the website sale any products or services?<br>
2. Does the website have affiliate sales?<br>
3. Does the website generate revenue from ads?<br>
<br><br>
After this, we must ask; does the average website owner put in effort into SEO, marketing, and sales? How much effort does he put into it? Does he have a hundred blog posts or does he have a total of three blog posts? <br><br>
Does he have a nice design or did he put minimal effort into that? Did the owner focus on his website speed, onsite, offsite SEO, social media marketing, gorilla marketing, ads, etc? How many products are for sale? How many services does he sell? How much are these products and services priced at? Depending on the answers to the questions above, the website owner could make a few dollars a month or several hundred thousand a year, and in some cases even more. <br><br>

Some websites easily make 10k or 20k a month from ads just from the sheer amount of traffic on their website.<br><br>

<h2 style="padding-bottom: 5%;padding-top: 10%;">Advertising Money</h2> 
<img src="./images/undraw_treasure_of9i.svg"   alt="An image of a person with a treasure chest" loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 8%;padding-bottom: 10%;">

<p>Website owners can also make money from Affiliate marketing. When a website has a ton of blog posts with lots of traffic it can generally benefit from advertising affiliate products.

	Different affiliate products pay different amounts and different affiliate companies pay different also. For example, amazon’s affiliate program might pay you 15 dollars for selling three dog treats on your website, whereas click bank will pay you 200 or more depending on the item. This can substantially affect how much the average website owner makes. <br><br>
	
	Additionally, a website owner's income also greatly depends on their niche. Your ROI will differ greatly depending on how small or big your niche is as this will affect how fast you can make money from that niche. Not only does the niche you choose affect how much you will earn as a website owner, but also Some niches just have better affiliate programs and better pay. You can see an example of this when you look at payouts for the financial niche vs the gaming niche. You stand to make so much more from a website focused on the financial niche. <br><br>
	
	You can make lots of money with affiliate marketing especially if you have tons of affiliate products and tons of website users. Many Affiliate Marketers are making 6 -7 figures year after year.
	
	You can't just make a website and start ranking on google and making money from your affiliate marketing. You also need to work on your SEO, optimize your content, and of course your web design. Which we'll discuss in greater detail below. <br><br>

<br><br>                                  
<p>
	250 thousand websites are created each year as of 2021. So Web designers and developers are looking towards Search Engine Optimization to make the most of their websites. This means they are using tools like AHREF's, Google trends, Yoast, and many other tools to make sure their website is being indexed by google, bing, yahoo, and any other relevant search engines to ensure their website is seen by the most amount of people possible. <br><br>

	Lots of research can go into just one article to make sure it ranks well so users can see affiliate items, ads, services, products of the owner's website.

		So we mentioned optimizing your website can help website owners make money, but let's get more depth into that. Now as mentioned there are several ways to optimize your website to help you make more money as a website owner. How well you optimize your website will largely affect how much money you will make.

		So let's talk about different website owners and how much they would expect. A website owner with no focus on SEO will be spending tons of money on ads, guest posting, influencer marketing, and other types of internet marketing. <br><br>
		
		A website owner with tons of focus on SEO, where the website has tons of articles with good titles, good descriptions, lots of keywords, and long-form content will spend much less money on ads and will have much better brand recognition. Therefore, the website owner can then afford to make more money from their site by having their website working for them.
		
		The average website owner doesn't really put as much focus on SEO as they should and if they did they would make much more money. SEO is used to bring more users to your website and consequently, will get more users to click your ads, and buy your products or services.<br><br>
		
		When you focus on SEO you also are focusing not only on traffic, but you get a much more targeted response.</p>
