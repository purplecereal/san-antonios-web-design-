					<p>		 
						This is the complete web design guide for anyone who is interested in building their own website. <br><br>
						This article is perfect for the seasoned web developer, the business professional, business owner or the casual blogger. <br><br>
						 You can learn something at almost any level simply by reading this article..  

						</p>
						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">What is web design</h2>
						 <p>

							Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content intended for the Internet. Modern web design goes beyond how things look (aesthetics) to include how things work (functionality).<br><br> Web design is not limited to websites as it includes other uses such as web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.

Let’s take it from the top. The first thing you need to understand about web design is user experience and user interface design. <br><br>

User experience is the process of building a website with the specific  intent of creating a seamless,interesting and fun experience for your users who use your website, mobile app or web app. <br><br>

This means you will need to create something that will not only grab the attention of your website users but that will also create an interesting and easy to use website. You don’t want to confuse your website visitors and you don’t want to scare them away either. <br><br>


After user experience you really need to understand the user interface design or Ui. Which basically is just how the site looks, this covers more about how the site looks and less about how the site feels. If that makes sense, in other words user interface is what the website user sees and user experience is how easy the website is to navigate. <br><br>


So now that you have a somewhat good understanding of user experience and user interface design when it comes to web development, let’s go ahead and talk more about colors, which fall into a deeper level of the two mostly into ui. 

						 </p>
						 <h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Color</h2>
						 											   
								   
						<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/colours__1__1OEw0EjAJ.jpg"  loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
							 <p>


								So when you’re building a website for yourself or someone  else you really need to take color psychology into account and how these colors will look together. For instance, we use a purple and white design which mostly promotes a feel of luxury and trust in our brand. <br><br>

								Other places like Walmart, discord, vs code, twitter and facebook use a blue and white theme which is used solely to create trust in the brand and don’t really cater to any specific client base or demographic. <br><br>
								
								There are also other colors that are used to insight other feelings in their website users. 
								
								For instance did you know that green is used as a calming color? Shopify uses green for their branding, perhaps it’s because their prices can scare a lot of average folk away? Idk but We build shopify stores here for anyone interested.
								
								Another thing you need to understand about colors is understanding what colors work well together. <br><br>
								
								You can use a website like <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolers.co</a>  to help you pick out a few colors that might work together. There is also <a href="https://paletton.com/">Palleton.com</a>  and <a href="https://colordesigner.io/">Colordesigner.io</a> to name a few. 
								
								Once you make a few websites or have a few made for you, you will start to get a better understanding of what colors go good together and what colors go great together for a particular brand, concept or niche. <br><br>
								
								Before we go on to the next topic I just want to touch on colors just a bit more. I know it’s probably getting repetitive for some of y’all but hear me out. 
								
								One last thing you need to understand about choosing the right color is you want to make sure you choose the right color for the right nice. <br><br>
								
								So what I mean by this is you pretty much need to be sure you aren't using weird color schemes together like black and purple for a cooking website or using a red background with blue, yellow and green font together for any website.  
								
								
								There are plenty of websites that do this.<br><br> However they are not professional in their design and a professional will look at it and have some real questions. You don’t want to go down that road.
								
								As I mentioned before you will get a feel for this as you get farther on your web design journey
								
								
											Let’s look at the next aspect of web design; fonts.
								</p>
								  
							</p>
							<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Fonts</h2>
						 
												  
									  
						   <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/fonts__1__8JcXb1Mg5.jpg"  loading="lazy"  height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
								<p>			
								
									<p>
										So as you get more experienced in your web design journey or as you have more websites built for you,whichever one. You will start to learn about how different fonts can create a totally different look on your website and how some fonts are simply not to be used on your website.<br><br> 

										You will also learn that some fonts and font sizes work on some backgrounds and not others, so make sure you pay close attention to what font’s you are using and make sure it looks good and not random.<br><br>
										
										You will notice that using many different fonts will look a bit weird, especially as your site begins to get larger. You really want to make sure you use at most one or two fonts in general on your website and try to be consistent whenever possible.
										

									</p>



								</p>
								<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Alignment</h2>
									  
													  
										  
							   <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/alignment__1__dFToh2XJK.jpg"  loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
									<p>			
									
										<p>
											
											So this particular top does go back a bit to user interface design but it is important that we do not skip this particular topic.

											When you are planning out your website or building it you will start to notice that when your different elements such as images, icons and fonts align your website will have a cleaner look. <br><br>
											
											You can learn more on this by googling user interface design or just reading some of our other blogs where we speak more about ux such as any of the links below:
											
											<br><br><a href="https://sanantonioswebdesign.com/25-web-professional-tips.html">25 proffesional web design tips</a><br><br>

										</p>
										<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Spacing</h2>
															  
												  
									   <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/spacing_8pvOfo0IQ.jpg"  loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
											<p>			
											
												<p>
													
													You will notice that having a proper amount of white space on your website can not only increase your website engagement but it can also increase the way your website looks by adding  a more seamless and intricate design. <br><br>

													Sometimes having more white space or background space on your website can actually make your website look more professional as opposed to just stuffing as much crap as possible as you can on your web pages.<br><br>
													
													
													Another thing you really need to make sure you understand about spacing is that when used properly not only can it add to your design but it can also add to a better experience for your web site users. 
													
													Sometimes more spacing is better and can even help get your point across. <br><br>
													
													Be mindful of how you use spacing on your web pages and how it can affect your google ranking by effecting your user engagement.
													
													You can learn more about your google ranking and seo by looking at the following web pages:<br><br>

										</p>
										<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Images</h2>
																									  
												  
									   <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/pexels-cottonbro-5083405__1__kURTDJ8Dh_.jpg" loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
											<p>			
											
												<p>
													
													When you are adding images on your website you want to make sure that your website is using only high quality images and you also want to make sure your images do not slow down your website. <br><br>

You can use a cdn like imagekit to help increase your websites loading speed and try out different image file types to increase your file size. 

An example of this would be to use a jpeg file as opposed to a png file as jpeg files are usually much smaller. <br><br>

Not only do you want to use compressed quality images on your website you also want to make sure you are using images that are relevant to your website and the webpage the image is on.

One more thing you can try to do is try to make sure you are geotagging your images if you are trying to improve your local seo. <br><br>

The last thing you want to do with your images is make sure you are using alt tags so that people who have trouble seeing or are possibly color blind are able to know what is going on with your website. You don’t want to exclude someone from your website experience just because they might not be able to see what others might be able to see. This is very important and is often referred to as accessibility amongst web developers.
