					<br><br>
					<p>For small business website owners, picking a reliable hosting provider is vital. Your choice will have a large impact on revenue and customer satisfaction, and will ensure that those impacts are positive rather than negative.  
                        Let’s talk about who this article is for. This article is for more honed toward business owners and beginners, who need a website design and web hosting.
                        
                        <br></br>
                        <br>
						If you're just getting started with making a website, reading some lists of hosting provider suggestions can feel overwhelming. People are listing off features like PHP versions and HTTP/2, while you’re probably just looking for a simple, beginner-friendly way to make a website.
<br><br>
These days, having a business website is essential, and there are a variety of tools and platforms that can help you build your online presence. Although certain website builders and e-commerce platforms include hosting as part of their product, in some cases — often if you bought your web address or domain as a standalone product — you'll need to acquire your own web hosting. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
<h2>How much is web hosting? </h2>
<br><br><p>
                        
                        Well web hosting prices for small businesses can vary from as little as 0$ a month to as high as 250 a month or sometimes higher. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side you can start
                        with bluehost or namecheap. If you are a developer, you can get as low as 0/m for your website with github or 000host. 
                        However, these are not ideal for business owners who want serious web design hosting These are more for small project
                        designs and testing.  <br><br> You will find answers to questions such as “what is the best web host to use”, 
                        and “how much is a host for a website”, as well as “can I web host for free”, as mentioned above.  Again, in most cases you will not want to web host for free for security reasons and for scalability reasons, 
                        <br><br>free web hosting is more for IT people and developers who can code in most cases. You really just want to choose the best web design hosting site for your small business in 2021.
                        If you are expecting any kind of real traffic, which you should be if you want customers from organic seo, then you will want to look
                        over the list below. </p>

						<h2>Best Web design hosting for business: Cloudways</h2>

							<br><br> 
							<a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=1004605"><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/clwayreviews_9vglOq6eB.PNG?updatedAt=1634110798286" height="50%" width="80%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;" alt="image of Cloudway hosting site reviews"></a>
						
							<br><br> This web hosting service offers ssd, automatic backups, self healing, and of course a cdn for fast loading websites. Which is optimal for the website owner in San Antonio, who is serious about their website scaling in the search engines. 
							<a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=1004605">Get cloudways web hosting for your small business</a></p>

						<P>	“Cloudways web hosting is a managed cloud hosting platform that emphasizes simplicity, choice, and freedom,” he writes.  “The Platform is built to facilitate businesses in deploying and scaling their online assets without worrying about the underlying hosting solution.”

One of the things that will attract small businesses are the options.
<br><br> 
In an interview with the ceo of cloudways web hosting stated the following:<br><br>
“There’s a choice of five industry-leading IaaS providers and it’s easy to deploy almost all PHP powered applications. Cloudways provides choices so that the Platform remains a great fit for a very broad set of businesses.”
<br><br>
One of the big advantages here is the flexibility Cloudways offers ecommerce SMBs in how their websites are hosted. There’s a lot to choose from. You can find what’s right for your own unique enterprise. Cloudways makes both server management and application hosting simple with 50 features .
<br><br>
“These features cover all the important aspects of server optimization and security.”

For example, small businesses can migrate their own SSL certificate or get one installed through the Platform. They can start a free trail by clicking a tab.
<br><br>
Shared Hosting is one of the models that small businesses favor because it is cheap. Here’s why cloud hosting is better.

Scalability

Scaling the server to meet demand. In the cloud, scaling resources is about adding virtual servers. There are no physical aspects so you can deal with traffic spikes quickly.
<br><br>
Whilst Cloudways Web Hosting is obviously for the more tech savvy business owners or at least the business owners who can employ the right tech savvy people, Cloudways Web Hosting is a no brainer. For less tech savvy busines owners with less access to programers and devops, we suggest blue host. Which is our number 2 pick on this list.<br><br>
						
<br><br>
When looking for managed WordPress hosting, you’ll no doubt come across many companies that offer similar services. While the vast majority of web hosts offer managed WordPress hosting on a shared, VPS, or dedicated server environment, one company has truly stepped out of the norm and provided a unique managed hosting solution.

That company is Cloudways.<br><br>

<br><br>
Cloud hosting means your site is stored on multiple servers, compared to traditional hosting where your site is stored on one server (with a backup)
Because your site is on multiple servers, it can be migrated easily in the case of any incidents
Cloud hosting improves uptime because one of the other servers in the network can take over if anything goes wrong
It’s usually faster than traditional hosting, the server can detect your customers’ location and transmit content from the server nearest to your customer

                            <h2>Best Web hosting for beginners:  Bluehost</h2>
							<br><br>
							<a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/sanantonioswebdesign69/"><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/bluehost_home_page_mFO7jQk2U.jpg?updatedAt=1604271489620  loading="lazy" height="50%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;" alt="image of bluehost hosting site"></a>

                            <p>Bluehost web hosting offers shared, VPS, dedicated, reseller, WordPress, and WooCommerce hosting. Bluehost’s disk space, though, is slightly more limited than with some of its competitors’. What’s more, servers can slow down if your website experiences a surge in traffic – for example, if you were running a paid social media campaign. 
								Hosting with bluehost is as easy as creating an account with them and choosing one of their plans starting at 3/m. If you want something cheap, they are the company for you. However, with this price. <br><br>
								<br><br>At 99.98%, Bluehost’s uptime is on par with HostGator’s, and it’s a very impressive figure – in fact, it amounts to less than two hours of downtime over an entire year. Considering the fact that 100% uptime is impossible to guarantee, Bluehost’s figure becomes even more impressive.
								Bluehost’s support is excellent. In fact, when we tested it out ourselves, Bluehost’s support exceeded our expectations by a whopping 9% – surpassing the other three hosts we tested. HostGator only exceeded our expectations by 3%, while InMotion and A2 Hosting didn’t live up to our expectations at all!

We were most impressed by Bluehost’s knowledge center, but its live chat was also stellar. Both phone and live chat support are available 24/7. In fact, Bluehost was the only host we tested that exceeded expectations in all areas of its help and support!
								
								<br>
								<br>
								you have to set up many things up yourself, so this is definitely more for the somewhat computer savvy business person on a budget. <br><br> However, they do have on press wordpress install, however, you will still want to consult a website developer/designer in san Antonio in most cases, as you should with any other host.<br><br>

								Bluehost is a popular web host that makes a great option for beginners thanks to its affordable pricing and beginner-friendly onboarding process.

Once you sign up for Bluehost, the Bluehost website wizard will guide you through setting up your website in just a few minutes.
