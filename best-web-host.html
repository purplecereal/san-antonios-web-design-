					<p><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: tomato;">Choosing the best website hosting For small business website owners is vital. Your choice will have a large impact on revenue and customer satisfaction. </span><br><br> Your web hosting choice will ensure that those impacts are positive rather than negative. Let’s talk about who this article is for. This article is for more honed toward business owners and beginners, who need a website design and web hosting.

                        
                        <br></br> 
                        <br>
						If you're just getting started with looking for the best website hosting, reading some lists of website hosting provider suggestions can feel overwhelming. People are listing off features like PHP versions and HTTP/2, while you’re probably just looking for a simple, beginner-friendly way to make a website.

<br><br>
These days, having a business website is essential, and there are a variety of tools and platforms that can help you build your online presence. Although certain website builders and e-commerce platforms include hosting as part of their product, in some cases — often if you bought your web address or a domain as a standalone product — you'll need to acquire your web hosting.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<h2>How much is the best website hosting? </h2>
<br><br><p>
    Well, website hosting prices for small businesses can vary from as little as <span style="color: tomato; font-size: x-large;">$0 a month to as high as $250 a month</span> or sometimes higher. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side you can start with Bluehost or NameCheap.<br><br>
    
    If you are a developer, you can get as low as 0/m for your website with GitHub or 000host. However, these are not ideal for business owners who want serious website hosting These are more for small project designs and testing.<br><br>

    You will find answers to questions such as <span style="color: tomato; font-size: large;">“what is the best web host to use”</span>, and <span style="color: tomato; font-size: large;">“how much is a host for a website”</span>, as well as <span style="color: tomato; font-size: large;">“can I web host for free”</span>, as mentioned above. Again, in most cases, you will not want to web host for free for security reasons and scalability reasons,<br><br>
    
    free web hosting is more for IT people and developers who can code in most cases. You just want to choose the best web hosting site for your business. If you are expecting any kind of real traffic, which you should be if you want customers from organic SEO, then you will want to look over the list below.

						<br><br>	<a href="https://platform.cloudways.com/signup?id=1004605"><span style="font-size: x-large; text-align: center;">Get Cloudways hosting</span> </a></p>

						<P>	Cloudways website hosting is a managed cloud hosting platform that emphasizes simplicity, choice, and freedom,” he writes. “The Platform is built to facilitate businesses in deploying and scaling their online assets without worrying about the underlying hosting solution.” One of the things that will attract small businesses is the options.

                            An interview with the CEO of Cloudways web hosting stated the following: <br><br><br><br>
                            
                          <span style="font-size: x-large; color: steelblue;"> “There’s a choice of five industry-leading IaaS providers and it’s easy to deploy almost all PHP-powered applications. Cloudways provides choices so that the Platform remains a great fit for a very broad set of businesses.”  </span>   <br><br><br><br>
                            
                            One of the big advantages here is the flexibility Cloudways offers e-commerce SMBs in how their websites are hosted. There’s a lot to choose from. You can find what’s right for your unique enterprise. Cloudways makes both server management and application hosting simple with 50 features.
                            
                            <br><br> <br><br><span style="font-size: x-large; color: steelblue;">   “These features cover all the important aspects of server optimization and security.” </span> <br><br> <br><br>For example, small businesses can migrate their SSL certificate or get one installed through the Platform. They can start a free trial by clicking a tab. <br><br>
                            
                            Shared Hosting is one of the models that small businesses favor because it is cheap. Here’s why cloud hosting is better. Scalability Scaling the server to meet demand. In the cloud, scaling resources is about adding virtual servers. There are no physical aspects so you can deal with traffic spikes quickly.
                            
                            Whilst Cloudways Web Hosting is obviously for the more tech-savvy business owners or at least the business owners who can employ the right tech-savvy people, Cloudways Web Hosting is a no-brainer. <span style="color: tomato; font-size: large;"> For less tech-savvy business owners with less access to programmers and DevOps, we suggest blue host. Which is our number 2 pick on this list.</span> <br><br>
                            
                            
                            
                            When looking for managed WordPress hosting, you’ll no doubt come across many companies that offer similar services. While the vast majority of web hosts offer managed WordPress hosting on a shared, VPS, or dedicated server environment, one company has truly stepped out of the norm and provided a uniquely managed hosting solution. 
                            
                            <br> <br>
                      <span style="font-size: x-large; color: steelblue;">That company is Cloudways.</span> 
                      <br> <br>                        
                            
                            Cloud hosting means your site is stored on multiple servers, compared to traditional hosting where your site is stored on one server (with a backup) Because your site is on multiple servers, it can be migrated easily in the case of any incidents Cloud hosting improves uptime because one of the other servers in the network can take over if anything goes
                            
                            wrong It’s usually faster than traditional hosting, the server can detect your customers’ location and transmit content from the server nearest to your customer.

                            <h2>Best website hosting for beginners: BLUEHOST
                            </h2>
							<br><br>
							<a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/sanantonioswebdesign69/"><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/bluehost_home_page_mFO7jQk2U.jpg?updatedAt=1604271489620  loading="lazy" height="50%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;" alt="image of bluehost hosting site"></a>

                            <p>Bluehost web hosting offers shared, VPS, dedicated, reseller, WordPress, and WooCommerce hosting. Bluehost’s disk space, though, is slightly more limited than with some of its competitors. What’s more, servers can slow down if your website experiences a surge in traffic – for example, if you were running a paid social media campaign. 
                                
                                Hosting with Bluehost is as easy as creating an account with them and choosing one of their plans starting at 3/m. If you want something cheap, they are the company for you. However, with this price. <br><br>


                                <span style="color: tomato; font-size: x-large">At 99.98%, Bluehost’s uptime is on par </span> with HostGator’s, and it’s a very impressive figure it amounts to less than two hours of downtime over an entire year. Because 100% uptime is impossible to guarantee, Bluehost’s figure becomes even more impressive.<br><br>
                                
                                Bluehost’s support is excellent. When we tested it out ourselves, Bluehost’s support exceeded our expectations by a whopping 9% – surpassing the other three hosts we tested. HostGator only exceeded our expectations by 3%, while InMotion and A2 Hosting didn’t live up to our expectations at all! <br><br>
                                
                                We were most impressed by Bluehost’s knowledge center, but its live chat was also stellar. Both phone and live chat support are available 24/7.  <br><br> <br><br><span style="font-size: x-large; color: steelblue;">Bluehost was the only host we tested that exceeded expectations in all areas of its help and support! </span><br><br><br><br>
                                
                                you have to set up many things yourself, so this is more for the somewhat computer-savvy business person on a budget.
                                
                                However, they do have on-press WordPress install, however, you will still want to consult a website developer/designer in san Antonio in most cases, as you should with any other host.<br><br>
                              
                                <br><br><br><br> <span style="font-size: x-large; color: steelblue;">                                Bluehost is a popular web host that makes a great option for beginners thanks to its affordable pricing and beginner-friendly onboarding process.</span> <br><br><br><br>

                                 Once you sign up for Bluehost, the Bluehost website wizard will guide you through setting up your website in just a few minutes.  
                                
                                Bluehost also has built their custom hosting dashboard on top of the “standard” cPanel dashboard that makes it a lot easier to manage important parts of your hosting account, like creating your custom email address.  <br><br>
