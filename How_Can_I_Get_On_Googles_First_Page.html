						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">How can I get on Google’s First Page?</h2>

						<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/2l9aizfajk/google_HlBZDmnOF.jpg"  loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
						<p>You can use long tail SEO and you can understand it by a simple example:<br><br>

                            “Head’ keyword = “SEO guide”
           
							<br><br>  “Long-tail =  “SEO guide for small businesses 2020” 
           
            
           
							<br><br>Using single Keywords like "Web Design" or "SEO" might not send you a ton of traffic. However, long-tail keywords do in total when you add a bunch of them up.
           
            
           
           For example, I was able to increase my organic traffic by a few hundred monthly by just using a long-tail keyword strategy. <br><br> Long-tail searches also make up the majority of searches on Google.
           
            
           
            
           
           You should target these long-tail keywords because they’re easier to rank for. And that means they’ll usually take less time and money.<br><br>So you’re not going up against the mammoth, industry-leading companies on these search engine result pages (SERPs).Still skeptical of the power of long-tail strategies? Let’s have a look upon it. How Amazon makes 57% of their sales from long-tail keywords.<br><br>
           
            
           
           How? Because long-tail searches are looking for very specific information, whereas short-tail keywords are more general.
           
            
           
           If you can give the searcher specific information, they’re going to stick around and convert.<br><br>Here’s an example SERP of a long-tail keyword search to help you get an idea of how it’s possible to rank for them.  <br><br>A good SEO presence has the power to drive inbound traffic that could grow your business for years to come.Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket for “SEO Guide,” create more content and optimize it for long-tail searches to dominate the SERP’s!<br><br>
           
            
           
           Now let’s talk about a few ways to rank for the more popular terms that you just can’t seem to resist. And let’s do it without any ‘classic’ SEO.  
           
            
           
            
           
            
           
            
		</p>
		<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Pay to reach the top of the AdWords search network:</h2>
		<p>
			

            
           
            
           
           AdWords is Google’s paid advertising product. Have you ever seen those ads that appear at the top or side of your screen? Those are AdWords ads that a company paid for so that people will notice their business whenever they’re searching Google.<br><br> And, they only have to pay whenever someone clicks on the ad. This is known as cost-per-click advertising (CPC).
           
            
           
           this sounds like a great opportunity to expand your business. <br><br>After all, people are on Google all the time and when they catch your ad, they will head to your site and you will gain more customers.<br><br>Besides claiming about 80% of internet users, AdWords is also easy to launch and you can set a budget. Also, ads are placed at the right place at the right time.
           
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">You Pay For Clicks,Take benefit from it:</h2><p>

		   

           Of course, you know that with Google AdWords you’re paying for clicks. This wasn’t a problem a long time ago when rates were more reasonable, you know, pennies instead of dollars. <br><br>The problem nowadays is that a start-up or new business is dropping $5 or more per click to get people to visit their site. <br><br>Sure That may increase visitors because you’re appearing at the top of the Google search page.
           
            
           
            
           
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;"> Use Limited Number of characters to get first page:</h2><p>

		   
            
           
            
           
           One gripe that you’ll hear about AdWords is that there is a limit on the number of characters that you’re allowed; 25 in the headline, 35 each in the two lines of text and 35 in the display URL.<br><br> While this isn’t exactly the end of the world, this restriction can make using AdWords a bit tricky. <br><br>On top of all the other tasks you have to do, you now have to brainstorm and come up with an attention-grabbing headline, keywords, the benefits of your product and some sort of call-to-action. That can be challenging to accomplish with a set amount of characters.In short, you have to choose your words very carefully if you want to get the most out of AdWords.
           
            
           
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Best match with the Google’s searches:</h2><p>

		  

            
           
           Google only wants to feature high quality websites,If you did a mistakes you will never get traffic. And, you don’t want to lose your presence on Google because of a simple oversight.
           
            
           
           I see people take down landing pages while directing clicks to these pages. <br><br> Google catches this, so avoid that kind of mistakes.
           
            
           
           You don’t need to organically rank for a keyword to get traffic for that keyword. Just remember to match the searcher’s intent and mimic the organic results to drive traffic.
           
            
           
            
           
		</p>		   <h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;"> Write blog posts that outranks your competitor’s content:</h2>
		<p>

            
           
           Creating content that attracts visitors to your website is an important part of your online marketing strategy.According to Google, 90% of Millennial’s go online daily, and 55% of them search for information about the product before purchasing it.<br><br> So the more people you drive to your website, the more leads you have.Write down every sub-header your competitors use and run a deep research on each of them.<br><br> This paves the way for you to “out-optimize” your competition.To outrank your competitor’s content you can do two things.
           
            
           
            
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Use Niche-related Keywords:</h2><p>

           

           
           Stalk your competitors’ blogs for inspiration and learn what tactics they use. Analyze what topics they write about and how they structure their articles. This will give you an idea of a framework.Than choose your keywords wisely.
           
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Use SERP’s  first page result in selection of best keywords:</h2><p>
		   

           
           Google the topic. You will get a bunch of articles that are good enough to make it to the SERP’s first page. Google perceives them as the best possible result which means that you can learn from them.you can select best out of it.
           
            
           
            
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Write valuable, unique content:</h2><p>

		   

           
            
           If you want to start ranking for the top keywords, you need to produce valuable, unique content and lots of it.On top of that, you also need to optimize your content to generate the highest CTR possible. Why?<br><br> Because optimizing headlines and meta descriptions for searchers can result in a 10% increase in CTR.And an increase in CTR means you’re on your way to ranking higher.
           
	
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Be relevant and write to readers:</h2><p>

		   

           
           Google your sub headers and see what articles come up. Try to see how accurate the content is and what else you could add.I know, optimizing your article for Google seems to be the most important factor of your work. <br><br>But, it doesn’t matter if Google adores your content if your readers don’t get what they want.Use simple language and don’t stuff your article with unnecessary words just for the sake of keyword optimization.
           
            
           
            
           
            
           
            
           
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Get reviewed and featured in round-ups:</h2><p>

		   
       
            
           
           Sometimes, spending money on PPC ads to rank higher for keywords isn’t an option.Spending too much time and money on creating long-form guides to rank for your desired keywords also may not be feasible.  <br><br>Luckily, you can still get your name featured in top-ranking content! All while doing a fraction of the work.Rather than having your official site placed on the top page of Google from AdWords or organic rankings, you can get featured in round-up posts with minimal time and effort. <br><br>let’s understand it by taking an example of Google.
           
            
           
           Just go to Google and search ‘‘The best SEO tools for 2020’’
          
           
            
           
            
           
           All the results are roundup-style posts in which the authors review and analyze the top tools.It’s basically free advertising.<br><br>You can get your name out to thousands upon thousands of consumers a month who are clicking on those top-ranking posts.
           
            
           
		   <br><br> If you’re featured on all of the comparison posts that already rank on the top page, you’re going to get traffic from each one of those.<br><br>This traffic will already be primed to buy from you.A few simple outreach efforts can now save you years of grinding away in obscurity to get your brand in front of eager searchers. <br><br>No time, no money, and just a little effort can still get your brand in the top results.If the deck is stacked against you in one game, just switch the game that you’re playing.
           
            
           
            
		</p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Conclusion</h2><p>

		   

           As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, It is hard to get on first page because there are an enormous amount of ranking factors that directly or indirectly influence your position on SERPs.<br><br> But  I would definitely recommend setting a course for creating great content, quality link building, and improving user experience.<br><br> Besides this, it’s always nice to carry out competition research to see how your top competitors optimize for the following ranking signals to borrow their tactics and reinforce your weak spots (if there are any).’’</p>
