<h2 id="what-is-shopify-development">What is Shopify Development?</h2>
<img src="./images/undraw_code_thinking_1jeh.svg" class="img-fluid rounded-md shadow" alt="An image of a shopify developer thinking">

<br><br>

<p>Shopify development is generally done by developers with a shopify development tier plan. Shopify development is usually done by an experienced developer who is familar with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
    <br><br>  Shopify uses liquid.js, and shopify developers can take advantage of shopify's development tier plan, so they can make custom websites while still using shopify's API to implement payments into your website.
    <br><br>
    This makes development faster for the developer, and of course easier for the user to manage everything for their eccomerce store including their email marketing, transactions, inventory, payments and other related aspects of running an E-Commerce business in 2023.

    Development stores include most of the features that are available on the Advanced Shopify plan.
    <br><br><br>
You can do the following while building and testing a development store:
<br><br>

    process an unlimited number of test orders
    create an unlimited number of unique products
    create up to 10 custom apps
    assign a custom domain
    <br><br>
A development store has the following limitations:
<br><br>
    You can only install free apps and partner-friendly apps.
    You can only test orders using the Bogus Test gateway or by enabling test mode for your payment provider. <br><br>You can't test orders using real transactions through active payment providers. Learn more about testing orders in development stores.
    You can't remove the password page.
    Your development store is no longer eligible for promotions or free trials after you transfer the store to a live plan.
    <br><br> <br><br><br><br>




</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
                  
                            <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="Shopify-development-Contracts">Shopify development Contracts</h2>
<br><br>

<p>The early contract phase with your developer or your web design agency can really take a couple weeks in some cases depending on how your schedule and theirs of course.
After you and your developer or web design agency figure out an agreement, then they would start designing your website. 

</p>
<br><br>





<h2 id="Shopify-Website-Design">Shopify Website Design</h2>


<p>The design phase is usually where the designers start trying out different things for different pages and sending them over to their project manager, who would present to you, for your approval, so this can take a couple weeks or days depending on the size of the site.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p><span style="color: steelblue; font-size: x-large;">Be sure that you proofread all your copy that is going to be on the site, make sure you really look at any images or videos to make sure they really meet your expectation. Look closely at margins, padding, corners, etc when looking at your images. 
</span></p>
<br>
<br>

<p>

    When you are proof reading your copy that will be on your site, make sure you're checking for grammar issues, font color, etc, because as the owner of the site, you do have the final word as to what will actually be public on your site. 
<br><br>
Make sure you're looking at prices and descriptions really closely as well as weight, captions, cta's etc. <br></br><br>You really want to make sure that when you approve stuff you are really paying attention and not just saying, yes. <br><br> If you don't really take a close look at things early on in the design, you will notice later on, there might be some issues where things take longer, if you have to go back and do everything over again, so make sure you really have an appropriate time slot for any meetings where your sign off is needed and don't be afraid to say, hey I will look at this later, in the mean time ,feel free to work on other aspects of the project. <br><br> That is totally okay to say, you definitely don't want to rush the design.

</p>


<br></br>
<br>
<h2 id="Shopify-Settings">Shopify Settings</h2>


<p>

    There are a lot of settings to configure in shopify for allowing collaborators to enable billing, to transferring ownership, to taxes, to weight, to user permissions. There are really quite a bit of settings that you may need to get familiar with.  IF you ever get stuck, you can always reach out to us and ask us any questions any time during any phase of the project. We are always happy to sell.

</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="Shopify-Development"><span style="color: tomato;">Shopify Development </span></h2>


<p>
    After your Ecommerce store is designed, development would then start. This will take longer, because getting the code to show the exact design that was made prior, can really take a few days to a few weeks depending how elaborate each page is. <br><br> If there are many elaborate sections on each page, sometimes a whole page can take weeks or even months, this is not uncommon, especially when there are a lot of products and or services that need a custom look for each item. A very detailed design can take months to develop. So keep that in mind when you are working with your developer/ agency.

</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>

   <span style="color: tomato;">  Now as the project matures, and your website starts to look better and more developed, you will be getting videos, or images of your website. There are instances as well, where your site will be developed locally, so you may not always see the changes to your site as it is being developed until the developers push everything to your live test site, which will usually be updated daily or weekly, depending how long certain tasks take.
</span>
</p>


<br>
<br></br>
<br>
<p>So to recap, your shopify site can take weeks or months depending on how elaborate the design is and how many products, services and features will be present on your website. 
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>So make sure you discuss this with your developer/agency so you can have an idea of how long development will take.
</p>

                                       Is shopify affordable?  YES, a resounding yes. Shopify's lowest monthly plan is only 9 dollars a month. 
                This is called their shopify lite plan. At only 9 dollars a month, this is less than the price of netflix, hulu, disney plus, two mcd's meals, or a tank of gas. Basically anyone can afford the price of shopify lite. 
                <br><br>
                
                If you combine the price of shopify lite with any of our financing options for custom development anyone making at least 25k a year can easily afford our custom shopify development service. 
                <br><br>
                
                Shopify development at it's lowest cost is about 1500 -2500 for a very small, professional web design. 
                This could be several pages with under a hundred products and a custom design.

               
               Shopify development is affordable for most small buisenesses in 2023. Many businesses may need financing. However, our work basically pays for it self. Feel free to check out our <a href="https://www.sanantonioswebdesign.com/Web-design-Portfolio.html">Web Design Portfolio</a>

               Let's talk about the varying factors that decide the cost of building a shopify website.
                    Firstly, let's talk about how much the development of your shopify website will actually cost.       <br><br>The cost of your e-commerce store largely varies by size of the shopify website as well as your developer experience in developing e-commerce websites.
So realistically, there are several factors that actually come into play when you are trying to figure out how much it costs to build a shopify website.
For starters are you hiring a web development agency to build your shopify website? If you are , you need to understand that prices vary based on several factors.
For instance a new web design company may not charge you as much, because they just not have the same expertise as we do. <br><br>It also depends on the amount of work you need done.
Is your shopify store going to be huge? Will it be a small shopify store with minimal content? Do you need to collect emails? Do you need auto respnoders, do you need to set up meetings in google calender?
Do you need custom content or articles written on your behalf? Do we need to create the copy for the website?

These are just a few of the considerations e-commerce development companies will need to know before they can give you a proper quote.
It also depends on your time limit, and how nice you want the site to look.
If you want an amazing website that will take months to develop, then you're looking at a much bigger bill then the small business that is just starting out and only needs a few products listed, an about page, a contact page, etc and only realy cares about getting the site up and doesn't nececarily need the kind of design that you see on more established websites.
<br><br>
We normally deal all different size companies. So we can really handle any size of shopify website. But let's break all this down into more detail to really explain everything in lamen terms.

                    
                    
                    The cost of a shopify website is the price of your shopify plan plus the price your web developer charges you, which can generally be anywhere from 5k to 100k.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Generally speaking when you are shopping for your an eccomerce developer to build your shopify site, you really want to make sure you already have at least a down payment to start. 
                    In some cases of course monthly payment plans are aceptable. Many companies require something to start. So you may have to pay the first month upfront. 
                    You will also of course need to be able to pay your shopify hosting fees every month. It is reccomended to pay several months ahead if you can or at least cast the money aside so you have it. <br><br>The reason being is when your website is down, not only are you not making money from it, you are also losing brand recognition, website authority, google ranking etc.
                    So it is a good idea to think carefully before going into a shopify hosting agreeemnt. For many small businesses ( depending on size of course) 30/m or more might be a signifigant barrier to entry.
                    If that is your case, consider contacting us about Open Cart ecommerce development. This way you only pay for hosting and you will own the code. <br><br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
That being said shopify has multiple plan tiers and we also of course offer financing, which we will get into both topics as you continue reading. <br><br>

                   In case you were curious, normally, even the cheapest web developers usually require a down payment just to start the contract. This is to protect them incase anything happens from the time the project is started and the time the project is finished.
                    <br>
                    <br>

Down payments for Shopify websites can greatly vary in size, which of course can drastically change how much it costs to build a shopify website. For instance, 
                   a down payment for a shopify website can generally cost somewhere between 2500 and 10k depending on how experienced your developer is. In some cases of course this could be even more as typically a down payment is treated as half of the full price of development.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Further more, The cost to build a shopify website can also vary by the size of the company. A large company, with lots of employees and overhead, tons of experience and managers etc, is going to charge much more to build your shopify website then a smaller company with just a few employees generally. 
                    <br>


                    <br>
                    So take the size of the company you hire into consideration, not only might you pay more depending on the size, but you might also have a little bit of communication lag. <br><br> So if you're not really sure, just give the company a call and check their prices. 
                    
                    
                </p>

                

                   

                <h2 id="financing" style="padding-bottom: 5%;padding-top: 10%;">Financing your shopify website</h2>

                <br>
                    <p>In many cases the company you find to build your shopify website might actually offer financing for this exact situation.. Many times, if you can get financed for the entire cost of development, things will go much smoother on both ends, and you may very well, not even have to pay anything upfront. 
This tactic is actually highly reccomended when considering the cost to build a shopify website as it gives you the best chance of generating more capitol for growth early on. <br><br>
As i'm sure you are aware , you also need to consider the cost it takes to generate website traffic. This can come in many different forms.
The cost to aquire website users could be measured in time, as in how much time would it take you to generate traffic from blog posts to start making sales, how much would that cost you have blogs written for you? 
Are you even going to write blogs, or are you using social media marketing or perhaps google or facebook ads to generate website traffic.

<br><br>
You also may need to wonder what is the cost per sale.. have you spoken to other shopify website owners in your niche to get an idea of how much ad money you will be spending to convert your shopify website users to buyers?
If you have not, or really even if you have, you should consider financing to allow for more capitol to go towards your internet marketing campaigns.

                            Shopify has several plan tiers that you need to understand. Some of which are very affordable and some of which are very expensive.
                            
                            
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Shopify has a basic plan, a shopify plan, an advanced shopify plan, a lite shopify plan, and a advanced shopify plus plan.  The shopify lite plan, is as low as 9/m. The shopify advanced plan is as high as 2,000 a month. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you look at the table above, you can also see that shopify's basic plan is 29/m, the shopify plan is 79/m and the advanced shopify plan is 299/month.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So let's get even more in depth here so we can really understand what's going.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So firstly, if you really want to understand shopify's pricing more just check out their pricing page at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pricing">www.shopify.com.</a> But before you do that, let's dive into why a developer or why an agency can really costs so many thousands of dollars.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <img src="images/undraw_Vault_re_s4my.svg" loading="lazy" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There is something called shopify liquid in shopify's platform, this is basically, what a developer has to access to make you a really custom site, that can look so much more clean, custom, elegant, beautiful, and even more functional, then what a regular shopify site that utilizes drop and drop can look like.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So a developer spends years learning their trade, learning how to code, how to understand documentation and how to really put a ton of different technologies together from html,css,php,js, and many more coding languages and technologies that could be relevant to each project. <br><br> When you put all these different skillsets together, plus of course years of design education, learning how to put things in certain orders, to make sure users actually click things and buy what you want them to buy, and really just understanding the best way to build a functional site that actually makes sales,<br><br> then you really start to understand why the cost of hiring a developer or agency can be so expensive. 
                            

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            So when you are considering your costs for ecommerce development, make sure you take all these things into consideration when you are jumping into a deal with a company.

                A shopify developer will make your site more custom. This means they will edit the shopify code for you and create something you won't normally see if you used the page builder with in shopify.  <br><br> Which is the difference between a custom shopify store and a shopify store not created by a developer.

                               Not every new site that is created is solely created just for money. However, many of them are. That being said several factors come into play that decides how much any of these 1.2 billion websites make and of course how much the average website owner makes.

        There is a big difference in how different website owners can make on average. <br>Most of this depends on several things.
        <br><br>
        1. Does the website sale any products or services?<br>
        2. Does the website have affiliate sales?<br>
        3. Does the website generate revenue from ads?<br>
        <br><br>
        After this, we must ask; does the average website owner put in effort into SEO, marketing, and sales? How much effort does he put into it? Does he have a hundred blog posts or does he have a total of three blog posts? <br><br>
        Does he have a nice design or did he put minimal effort into that? Did the owner focus on his website speed, onsite, offsite SEO, social media marketing, gorilla marketing, ads, etc? How many products are for sale? How many services does he sell? How much are these products and services priced at? Depending on the answers to the questions above, the website owner could make a few dollars a month or several hundred thousand a year, and in some cases even more. <br><br>
        
        Some websites easily make 10k or 20k a month from ads just from the sheer amount of traffic on their website.<br><br>

        <p>Website owners can also make money from Affiliate marketing. When a website has a ton of blog posts with lots of traffic it can generally benefit from advertising affiliate products.
        
            Different affiliate products pay different amounts and different affiliate companies pay different also. For example, amazon's affiliate program might pay you 15 dollars for selling three dog treats on your website, whereas click bank will pay you 200 or more depending on the item. This can substantially affect how much the average website owner makes. <br><br>
            
            Additionally, a website owner's income also greatly depends on their niche. Your ROI will differ greatly depending on how small or big your niche is as this will affect how fast you can make money from that niche. Not only does the niche you choose affect how much you will earn as a website owner, but also Some niches just have better affiliate programs and better pay. You can see an example of this when you look at payouts for the financial niche vs the gaming niche. You stand to make so much more from a website focused on the financial niche. <br><br>
            
            You can make lots of money with affiliate marketing especially if you have tons of affiliate products and tons of website users. Many Affiliate Marketers are making 6 -7 figures year after year.

                So we mentioned optimizing your website can help website owners make money, but let's get more depth into that. Now as mentioned there are several ways to optimize your website to help you make more money as a website owner. How well you optimize your website will largely affect how much money you will make.
        
                So let's talk about different website owners and how much they would expect. A website owner with no focus on SEO will be spending tons of money on ads, guest posting, influencer marketing, and other types of internet marketing. <br><br>
                
                A website owner with tons of focus on SEO, where the website has tons of articles with good titles, good descriptions, lots of keywords, and long-form content will spend much less money on ads and will have much better brand recognition. Therefore, the website owner can then afford to make more money from their site by having their website working for them.
                
                The average website owner doesn't really put as much focus on SEO as they should and if they did they would make much more money. SEO is used to bring more users to your website and consequently, will get more users to click your ads, and buy your products or services.<br><br>
                
                When you focus on SEO you also are focusing not only on traffic, but you get a much more targeted response.</p>
