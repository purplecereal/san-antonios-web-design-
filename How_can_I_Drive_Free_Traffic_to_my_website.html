                            Another option you can use to generate free traffic is to use high quality back links and guest posting. If you do not
                            
                             
                            
                            know what these things it’s okay. I will explain these as well. A high quality back link is a link that is directed to your
                            
                             
                            
                            website from a different website that already has tons of traffic going to it’s website everyday.  These types of sites
                            
                             
                            
                            are also called Authority sites. Essentially a high quality back links is a huge funnel.  People who go to the bigger
                            
                             
                            
                            websites will see your link and they will click on your link and wallah Free traffic.  Let’s talk about guest posting now.
